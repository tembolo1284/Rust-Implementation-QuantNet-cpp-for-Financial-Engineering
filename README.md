# QuantNet C++ to Rust: Financial Engineering Translation

## Overview
A Rust implementation of exercises from **QuantNet's C++ Programming for Financial Engineering** course. This project translates C++ concepts and patterns into idiomatic Rust, demonstrating how modern systems programming principles apply to quantitative finance.

## Objective

- Learn Rust by implementing familiar C++ patterns

- Explore memory safety without garbage collection

- Understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes in a financial context

- Compare and contrast C++ and Rust approaches to system design

## Structure
```
Level1/ - Basic Programming

Level2/ - Preprocessor and Pointers  

Level3/ - Classes and Objects

Level4/ - Advanced Features

Level5/ - Inheritance and Polymorphism

Level6/ - Exception Handling

Level7/ - STL Containers

Level8/ - Boost Libraries

Level9/ - Applied Computational Finance Project

```

## Key Transformations
| C++ Concept | Rust Approach |

|------------|---------------|

| Manual Memory Management | Ownership System |

| Inheritance | Composition + Traits |

| Pointers | References + Smart Pointers |

| Templates | Generics |

| Exceptions | Result/Option Types |

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ 

- Basic C++ knowledge helpful but not required

- Interest in quantitative finance
